Welcome to my personal website! I’m Qing An, a 5th year PhD student at [Rice University](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) advised by [Prof. Rahman Doost-Mohammady](http://doost.web.rice.edu/) and [Prof. Ashutosh Sabharwal](https://ashu.rice.edu/). I am broadly interested in Wireless System. My recent research focuses on massive MIMO, virtual/open RAN and AI/ML in wireless.
Previously, I got my Bachelor degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/), China and Master degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/).
